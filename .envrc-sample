# instructions
# ============
# fill the values
# rename it to .envrc
# place it at $HOME or root aka /root/

# this user will be used to access the server via SSH
# if not provided, a random username will be created along with the password
#export SSH_USER=

# EMAIL is used in multiple places
# - crontab
# - logwatch
# - as an alias for root in the server
# - on /etc/gitconfig

#export EMAIL=


# SERVER_IP is used in
# - nginx vhost (why do we need it, when we have a default vhost)
# - to setup PhpMyAdmin (why don't we have a subdomain to set it up?)
# probably get this using a script

#export SERVER_IP=


# if the password contains '=' char, then it may not work as expected

#export SMTP_USERNAME=
#export SMTP_PASSWORD=
#export SMTP_HOST=
#export SMTP_PORT=


# WP_HOSTNAME=
# the server should be able to serve any domain hosted in a server
# server_name _; # nginx
# if the following value is set, then send 403 for all other domains

#export WP_DOMAIN=


# create the following dynamically
#export SFTP_USER=sftprandom
#export SSH_USER=sshrandom

# set PHP-FPM in work in on-demand mode with a fixed set up max_children
# probably, you may calculate the max_childen depending on the total available memory in the server!
# ( total memory / max_memory in php.ini ) * 2
# on a 1GB server with a max_memory of 256MB for php, the max_children would be 4

#export PHP_MAX_CHILDREN=
#export PHP_MEM_LIMIT=

export nodejsversion=10

# no longer used
#export MEMCACHED_MEM_LIMIT=
